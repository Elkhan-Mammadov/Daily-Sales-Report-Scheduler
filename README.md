# Daily-Sales-Report-Scheduler
This project automates the creation of a daily sales report in Oracle Database. It calculates total sales, total cost, and total profit for each day and inserts the results into a dedicated reporting table. The process is scheduled to run automatically every night using `DBMS_SCHEDULER`.
